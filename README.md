 samples that use depth sensor data.

 software version: sqrt(-0.1)
 in other words, this is just an "imaginary unofficial test release" of code samples that are in the process of being made available in an alpha state.
 put here on github for early testing just to  make sure project files, submodules, and all source files are included and configured correctly.

 samples use librealsense api/library to get depth and ir data from realsense camera.
 samples developed and tested on r200 (aka ds4) realsense camera.
 samples only tested under windows OS.
 requires visual studio 2015

 this repo depends on librealsense and sandbox repos on github.  so if using tortoise git, be sure the recursive checkbox is checked to automatically fetch these dependencies.
 Then everything in the solution should sucessfully build on the first try.
